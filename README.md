# lab_playbook
Soultanas Group playbook of local lab protocols.

We hope that these methods will be of general use to the community. This document was initially created to be used as a quick go to guide for lab work which is more accessible than methods described formally in the literature. Nevertheless, we would like to add references where possible to ensure the playbook is in line with current methods.

We also hope that this document will also act as a template for other labs to create their own local playbooks. Often casual method descriptions can be more informative than published methods, which are becoming ever shorter due to journal requirements.

You are also invited to improve this playbook and push requests as you see fit.
